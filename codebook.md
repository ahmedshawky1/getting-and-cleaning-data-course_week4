Identifiers

    subject - The ID of the test subject
    activity_label - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken


Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

	
Activity Labels

    WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
    SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
    STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
    LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test


Steps:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
